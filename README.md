  Hi, I’m Jonathan Michel. I'm currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Before that,
I was a graduate student at Georgia Tech, where I earned a Ph.D. in Physics, with a focus on Soft Matter. I also hold a B.S. in physics
from Carnegie Mellon.

I’m interested in ...
-   I am broadly interested in simulations of physical phenomena. This also entails an interest in the technology,
   algorithms and data structures that support such simulations, including spatial indexing, massive parallelization,
   finite element methods, and spectral solvers.

 I’m currently learning ...
-   I am trying to improve my knowledge of running large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. I am also interested in
   coupling these simulations with hydrodynamics, to simulate low-Reynolds number flow in active biopolymer suspensions.

 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
 -  I would be interested to know if the code I have shared here has been helpful in a research setting. I am always interested
    to know of other researchers interested in the mechanics of filamentous networks, the interaction of fluids with slender
    structures, and the acceleration of large-scale, coarse-grained computational models of soft solids and complex fluids.
 
How to reach me:
-   I can be contacted at jmichel (dot) stl (at) gmail (dot) com, or at my (current) professional address, jamsps (at) rit (dot) edu.
